# u2accel

A tool to help measure acceleration for cars in NFS games. It was supposed to only support Underground 2, but then I decided
that making a tool for the whole series alltogether is a better approach.

## Why?  

Because speedrunning. We need to test some stuff, so I thought this would be a good idea to make our measurements little bit easier.  

## What can it?

- Supports U2
- Measure acceleration
- Make custom measuring ranges
- Global hotkey to reset calculations

## TODO List:

- Customazible hotkey
- MPH support
- Reports
- U1 support
- MW Support
- Carbon support

## How to use
Just open the program, then the game. Or game then program. Doesn't matter alot.  
Select a track and drive. If you need to reset - use Numpad0. I will add customizeable hotkey later on.
